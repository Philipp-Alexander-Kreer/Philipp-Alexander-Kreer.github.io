            <h3>Theoretical Physicist, AI Enthusiast, and Adventurer</h3>
            <p>I am a theoretical particle physicist at the Technical University of Munich with interest in explainable and robust AI systems. I am in the third year of the PhD and expect to finish in September 2025.
                In my free time I enjoy long-distance trekking, calisthenics, and cooking.</p>
